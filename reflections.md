# Reflections

It's quite nice to be done with this story, for the time being anyway; it's been bouncing around my head for the past couple of years.

I've long been fascinated by the argument known as "[Lady Lovelace's Objection](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/#LadLovObj)." It claims, roughly speaking, that computers are not capable of original thought, but are instead bound by the instructions given them by people. This claim was given a title by Alan Turing, whose famous paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" gave rise to the Turing test while arguing against Lovelace's position. Alas, Countess Lovelace died nearly a century before Turing's paper, and never had the chance to respond to Turing's arguments.

Hence the premise of my story: suppose that Lovelace and Turing had been contemporaries, and had had a chance to carry on a full-fledged debate on the nature of digital intelligence. What then?

Originally I had hoped to make the whole thing rather didactic. My own view is that Turing was mistaken, and Lovelace essentially correct; indeed I would go further and argue that Lovelace is [correct by definition](https://shaisachs.github.io/2020/07/27/argument-from-tautology.html). I had planned to write this story as a kind of dramatic exposition on this argument, and my own take on it.

For some reason or another I decided to step back from the precipice of rather dry intellectual exchange, and transpose the story into an entirely different context. Lovelace \(whose birth name was Augusta\) and Turing \(whose middle name was Mathison\) become relations - whether siblings or cousins, I'm not entirely sure - reflecting on their inheritance from a loving if somewhat quirky set of grandparents. The whole thing becomes something of a jumble: instead of algorithms we have recipes, instead of a universal Turing machine, we have typewriters and chefs. The exchange of letters follows some of the parameters of the real-world debate between Lovelace and Turing, but loosely at best.

There is something magical, in my eyes, about the epistolary format. It is so sparse that it forces the reader to fill in the blanks; and it has so much room for musings and melancholy, which I find somewhat relaxing. Moreover it opens up the possibility of hidden structure that has the whiff of believability about it: I like the idea that Mathi includes a recipe, of some kind or another, in every letter he sends to Augusta \(except the last\), for instance. At the same time, as the author, there is a pronounced danger of digression, and boring the reader with extraneous exposition. Altogether, it's a good challenge.

Furthermore, I knew I wanted to explore the [techno-magical realism](https://shaisachs.github.io/2018/05/05/the-menu.html) genre a little more. Hence we have a magical typewriter, capable of sending emails, composing recipes, and even sifting through boxes of old junk. That was fun, although it wound up being something of a smaller piece of the story than I had originally imagined. Tippy does loom large in what you might call a dramatic re-enactment of the Turing test, which wound up working out about the way I thought it would. The epistolary format is quite a challenge, and the genre gives it an interesting flavor - so I was happy to try it out.

Did I succeed? Not fully, no. This text is somewhat dry and repetitive, a little awkward, without a great deal of excitement or really any kind of action. I've done better; indeed perhaps I'll try to do better in a future revision. The didactic point which I had hoped to make gets, I think, rather convoluted and lost.

At the same time, I certainly did succeed in rendering this idea into some kind of concrete manifestation. I had given myself a goal of completing it, in roughly five thousand words, over the course of the month of November; I succeeded in that too. So there is a good deal of satisfaction to go around.

There were some hidden surprises along the way. I had originally thought that there would be some form of adventure, perhaps even a compelling conflict, in the narrative - perhaps Mathi needs help keeping a restaurant afloat, something like that. Perhaps even Augusta loans him the magical Tippy for a time, and Mathi winds up trying to fool Augusta rather than the other way around. Maybe I might have tried something like that, but it simply did not suit me in the end. What came as a genuine surprise was the literary allusion to the Wizard of Oz; that was nowhere in my original plan. But then I found myself comparing Tippy to the Tin Man and it occurred to me: well, why not? The themes of nostalgia and imitation are all right there for the plucking, and I've always loved that story a great deal. It was kind of a fun diversion.

Zooming out a little, it's interesting to me that surprises like this one should occur at all during the writing process. It's one of the most unrestrained productive processes I can think of: if a word appears on the page, I can delete it with ease. I can write something today and change it tomorrow, or indeed ten years from now. I have essentially perfect control over what I write. Or do I - since after all, I had no plans for this particular motif to appear, and yet here it is. This question itself appears in Turing's critique of Lovelace's objection: the computer surprises the programmer from time to time \(in fact, quite often\), therefore it must be somewhat intelligent of its own accord. It seems to me that there is a key difference between the intelligence of intent \(did I intend for the story to follow a certain path, and to use certain words?\) and the intelligence of outcome \(did the finished product align to my expectations? might I have changed it if it didn't?\) Turing conflated the two in his famous article, and as a result I think he missed some of the meaning behind Lovelace's original claim. That is to say, that originating a piece of work requires both the intelligence of intent and the intelligence of outcome; perhaps a rigorous rejoinder to Turing is that a computer may or may not have the former, but certainly lacks the latter.

Back to the story itself - I'm not entirely certain how this abstract exchange of ideas became a sentimental tale of nostalgia. I think it was always there in the premise of a shared inheritance, although it was not meant to take center stage. I have for a long time thought that home, as a literary motif, shares some really striking connections to Turing's notion of an "oracle machine" and its place in the arithmetic hierarchy. Exploring that in greater depth is a topic for another day, but I think the idea bled into this story and I suppose I'll let it stay.

The motif of reflection was a little late to the party, originally something of an afterthought. It blends in nicely with the larger question about how much, or how little, of a machine's intelligence belongs to its creator. And there are a handful of tie-ins to the Wizard of Oz in the bargain. Over and above that, it gave me the title for this appendix, which I think is a little amusing.

The conflict between Augusta and Mathi has changed quite a bit since the first draft, and I think for the better. Gone is the sharp hostility, replaced by a kind of genial ribbing. It's a bit open-ended as to whether Augusta is furious with Mathi still, or whether she's merely teasing him, and I rather like that. To begin with it makes the story that much more enjoyable to read - despite its artistic qualities I simply dislike conflict - but more than that I think it allows the reader to appreciate better the various ideas swirling around Mathi's cherished recipe, without the distraction of a family feud. More than that, it opens up some space to make th dramatized Turing test a little more interesting. I'm certainly glad to have reworked the ending a bit.

Allow me to close with a word about the first sentence of the story. This particular sentence has been in my head for a long time, and I'm not sure why; only that I like it very much. Of course, it calls to mind the idea at the heart of the story, Lady Lovelace's Objection. It introduces the search for the recipe, and it introduces our two main characters and their relationship; functionally it seems like a reasonable piece of writing. More than that, it's a somewhat oblique reference to [Blaise Pascal's famous apology](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/02/03/270680304/this-could-have-been-shorter), "I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time." I recently learned that the original line, in French, is a good deal longer than the English translation, which strikes me as absurdly funny. In truth there is only the most tenuous relationship between Pascal's apology, or the Provincial Letters in which it is embedded. Nevertheless, there is something that feels right about connecting these three thinkers in this way.

I'm certainly not a fan of including explanatory texts like this one as an appendix to my writing - the actual work should stand on its own, in my view - so you may take or leave this reflection as you see fit. I view it as something of a patch around the holes and missing pieces in the original story. However that may be, I hope the whole thing is enjoyable, and perhaps even thought-provoking.
